# Lumina — Brand Guidelines

## Who is this for?
Russian-speaking women, 22-40, who are curious about astrology. Some are experienced, some are exploring for the first time. They might be going through a transition — new city, relationship shift, career change — and looking for a framework to understand themselves. They're sophisticated, not naive. They want something that feels real, not gimmicky.

## How should Lumina make someone feel?
- **Intimate** — like opening a personal letter from the universe. Not broadcast. Personal.
- **Warm but mysterious** — candlelight, not fluorescent. Depth, not darkness.
- **Elegant** — like a beautiful illustrated book, not an app. Think: a leather-bound journal with gold leaf edges.
- **Trustworthy** — "this person actually knows what they're talking about." Quiet confidence, not shouting.
- **Safe** — a private space. This is YOUR reading. Not a social network. Not public.

## What Lumina is NOT
- Not a generic horoscope site (no "all Tauruses will have a great day!")
- Not a social network (no friends, no sharing, no likes)
- Not techy or cold (no "AI-powered", no dashboards, no data viz)
- Not woo-woo crystal shop (no dream catchers, no tie-dye, no "good vibes only")
- Not dark/gothy (we're celestial, not occult)

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
- **Primary background:** Deep midnight navy (#080C1F → #0F1433)
- **Warm accent:** Soft gold / amber (like candlelight) — for highlights, CTAs
- **Celestial accent:** Soft lavender/lilac (#C4B5FD) — for interactive elements
- **Text:** Warm cream (#F5F0EB) — never pure white
- **Supporting:** Muted rose, deep teal — for section variety

### Typography
- **Headings:** Serif (DM Serif Display) — elegant, book-like
- **Body:** Clean sans-serif (Inter) — readable, modern
- **Feeling:** Like the typography in a beautifully typeset astrology book from the 1920s, but readable on a phone

### Imagery Direction
- **Star maps & constellations** — antique celestial atlas style, gold lines on dark backgrounds
- **Moon phases** — photographic or illustrated, always present
- **Soft gradients** — deep navy to warm purple, like twilight sky
- **Gold foil textures** — subtle, not gaudy
- **NO:** stock photos of women looking at stars, no crystals, no generic zodiac clip art

### Illustration Style
- Fine gold lines on dark backgrounds (like celestial cartography)
- Geometric but organic — circles, arcs, orbital paths
- Constellation-style dot-and-line patterns
- Subtle glow effects — like stars actually emitting light

### UI Patterns
- Glass morphism (frosted glass cards) — already implemented
- Soft borders (white/10 opacity)
- Generous negative space — let content breathe
- Subtle animations — fade in, not slide/bounce

## Voice & Tone
- Gentle but confident
- Second person ("your chart reveals..." not "the chart shows...")
- Poetic when appropriate, never purple prose
- Bilingual: Russian should feel natural, not translated

## The One Image
If we had to base the entire brand on one visual metaphor:
**An antique celestial atlas page — gold constellation lines on deep navy, with elegant serif labels — viewed by candlelight.**

That's Lumina.
