# Design Reference: Greg Isenberg + Suraya Shivji — "Stop Shipping AI Slop"

## Core Workflow
1. **Google AI Studio** → one-shot prototype (functionality)
2. **Claude** → define HOW it should FEEL → brand guidelines
3. **Cosmos** → mood board (visual inspiration)
4. **Weavy AI** → generate visual assets (colors, buttons, images, logos)
5. **Figma** → compose final screens with generated assets
6. **Back to AI Studio** → refine with visual references

## Key Principles
- "What does it do" vs "How should it make you feel" — the second is equally important
- Brand guidelines = prompts (not corporate docs)
- Start with ONE image you love → base entire brand on it
- Colors first → backgrounds → buttons → images (building blocks like painting)
- Use Flux 2 Pro for general image gen, Ideogram for typography/logos
- Background removal in Weavy for clean assets
- Figma blend modes (overlay/hard light) for color harmony
- One visual reference can drive an entire product identity
- "If a brand is successful, you won't notice it in the final app. It'll just feel good."
